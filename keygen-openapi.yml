    The Keygen API is organized around REST principles. All requests **must** be made over TLS/SSL. We only support
    **TLS 1.2**, for security reasons. All API request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in **JSON**
    format.

    The API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We
    use built-in HTTP features, like authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.
    We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from any client-facing
    software application.

      summary: Generate a token
      description: |
        Generate a new token resource for a user, using the user's email and password. Keygen does not store your tokens
        for security reasons. After a token is generated, it cannot be recovered if lost. The token will need to be
        revoked if lost, and a new token should be generated. Alternatively, the existing token can be regenerated
        (rolled).

        By default, user tokens expire in 2 weeks, and admin tokens do not expire. A custom expiry may be provided in
        the token generate request. If the user does not have a password, a token must be generated via
        [the user's token relationship](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/users/#users-tokens)

        To generate a token for a product, see the [product token relationship](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/products/#products-tokens).

        To generate a license token, see the [license token relationship](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/licenses/#licenses-relationships-activation-tokens).

      description: |
        Fulfill a user's password reset request. Password reset tokens expire 24 hours after [requesting the reset](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/passwords/#passwords-forgot).
        For an example of self-hosting your password reset flow, please [see this repo](https://github.com/keygen-sh/example-password-reset-fulfillment).
        Alternatively, you can use [our Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/keygen/integrations).

        When the account is protected, and the user does not yet have a password set, they will not be able to set their
        initial password. Only admins may set the password for a passwordless user, unless the account is unprotected.

      summary: Generate a user token
      description: |
        Generates a new user token resource. User tokens, by default, expire after 2 weeks. Though this can be adjusted
        via the `expiry` attribute. Typically, you'd want to generate a token using [the tokens resource](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/tokens/#tokens-generate),
        using the user's email and password. But this endpoint can be used by admins to generate a token on a user's behalf.

        This endpoint is particularly useful for generating tokens for a user without a password, or if you want to
        manage logins another way, e.g. server-side.

      summary: Validate by license ID
      description: |
        Action to validate a license. This will check the following: if the license is suspended, if the license is
        expired, if the license is overdue for check-in, and if the license meets its machine requirements
        (if [strict](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/policies/#policies-object-attrs-strict)).

        Additional scopes can also be applied, and may be required by the license's policy, e.g. a policy may set
        `requireFingerprintScope=true`, which will require that you specify a `scope.fingerprint` within the validation
        request in order to pass validation.

        The scoping feature allows you to easily set up a node-locked or floating licensing model without additional
        logic on your end.

        ### Validation codes

        Below are the possible values for the `meta.code` key within the validation response. This can be used to better
        communicate failures to end-users and to handle specific failures within your application code.

      summary: Validate by license key
      description: |
        Action to validate a license key. This will look up the license by its key and check the following: if the license
        is suspended, if the license is expired, if the license is overdue for check-in, and if the license meets its
        machine requirements (if [strict](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/policies/#policies-object-attrs-strict)).

        Additional scopes can also be applied, and may be required by the license's policy, e.g. a policy may set
        `requireFingerprintScope=true`, which will require that you specify a `scope.fingerprint` within the validation
        request in order to pass validation.

        The scoping feature allows you to easily set up a node-locked or floating licensing model without additional logic
        on your end.

      summary: Ping heartbeat
      description: |
        Action to begin or maintain a machine heartbeat monitor. When a machine has not performed a heartbeat ping
        within the monitor window, it will automatically be deactivated. This can be utilized for machine leasing, where
        a license has a limited number of machines allowed, and each machine must maintain heartbeat pings in order to
        remain active.

        To illustrate further, consider a rather common scenario when dealing with leasing VMs:

        - The machine is activated for a new device using a unique VM GUID as a "fingerprint."
        - The machine sends their first heartbeat ping, starting the monitor.
        - The machine sends further heartbeat pings, within the heartbeat monitor window, to indicate that it is still alive.
        - The machine/software crashes. Normal machine deactivation fails to occur before the software program exits. This is now a "zombie" machine.
        - The heartbeat monitor detects that the machine has not sent a ping within the window, and subsequently deactivates the machine.

        **The default heartbeat monitor window is 10 minutes from time of last ping.** This can be configured via the
        license policy's `heartbeatDuration` attribute.

        Machines will be culled according to the policy's heartbeat cull strategy, after the machine's resurrection
        period has passed, if set.

      summary: Ping
      description: |
        Action to maintain a process heartbeat ping frequency. When a process has not performed a heartbeat ping within
        the monitor window, it will be considered dead and queued for deletion. This can be utilized for process
        leasing, where a license or machine has a maximum number of allowed processes, and each process must maintain
        heartbeat pings in order to remain active. This can be used in combination with machine heartbeats.

        Consider this common process leasing scenario:

        - One or more processes are spawned during application initialization, after the license has been validated and
          the underlying machine has been activated.
        - Each process sends their first ping and maintains a heartbeat ping frequency, according to the required
          heartbeat monitor window, to indicate that it is still alive.
        - The application crashes. The normal process kill-on-exit procedure fails to occur before the application
          exits. There are now one or more "zombie" processes.
        - The heartbeat monitor detects that the process has not sent a ping within the window, and subsequently kills
          the process.

        **The default heartbeat monitor window is 10 minutes.** This can be configured to a different value via the
        license policy's heartbeat duration attribute.

        Processes will be culled according to the policy's heartbeat cull strategy, after the process's resurrection
        period has passed, if set.

      description: |
        Request a password reset for a user. When the user does not already have a password, they will be invited to set
        a password. This will send an email to the user, if it is a valid email address that exists in our system. The
        email will contain a link leading to a password reset form securely hosted by Keygen. To send a customized
        email, see below.

        When the account is protected, and the user does not yet have a password set, they will not be able to set their
        initial password. Passwordless users are considered "managed" users, and depending on whether or not the account
        is protected, they may not have permission to set a password.

        To work around this, you may do one of the following:

        - Set a temporary password on the user. You can do this when creating the user, or you can do this after the
          fact. Once a password has been set, the user is no longer considered "managed" and may reset their password
          normally.
        - Set the account to unprotected. Though note what this entails — you may want to set all policies to protected
          to ensure certain actions can't be taken by users, such as license creation.

        In most cases, we recommend #1.

        Below you will find the various attributes for the token resource, as well as the token resource's
        relationships. The actual `token` string is hashed before being stored in our databases, thus is only available
        directly after generating/regenerating a token. Tokens with an expiry will automatically be deleted 90 days
        after their expiry, unless renewed.

                The strategy for distributing releases.

                ### Options

                - **`LICENSED`**:
                  Only licensed users, with a valid license, can access releases and release artifacts. API
                  authentication is required.
                - **`OPEN`**:
                  Anybody can access releases. No API authentication required, so this is a great option for rendering
                  releases on a public downloads page, open source projects, or freemium products.
                - **`CLOSED`**: Only admins can access releases. Download links will need to be generated server-side.
                  API authentication is required.

      description: |
        Below you will find the various attributes for the entitlement resource. Entitlements can be attached to
        policies and to licenses to grant named "permissions" for things such as application features.

        Entitlements can be attached to the following resources:

        - **Policies:**
          Any entitlement attached to a policy will automatically be attached to all licenses which implement the given
          policy.
        - **Licenses:**
          Entitlements attached to a license are one-off and only apply to that specific license resource.
        - **Releases:**
          Entitlements can be attached to releases through [constraints](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/releases/#releases-relationships-attach-constraints),
          in order to assert that a given licensee possesses the necessary entitlements before being allowed to access a
          release's artifacts.

    Group:
      type: object
      summary: The group object
      description: |
        Groups can be used to associate multiple users, licenses and machines under a single group. This is great for
        setting up "Teams" or group licenses. For example, you use an "ACME Co." group for a team license package that
        belongs to the ACME customer, making sure all licenses are associated with eachother.

        How resources can be added into a group:

        1. By specifying a `group` relationship during creation of a new resource. For example, to add a new license to
           a group, [specify the `group` relationship](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/licenses/#licenses-create-relationships-group).
        2. By changing an existing resource's group relationship. For example, to add an existing license to a group,
           [change it's group relationship](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/licenses/#licenses-relationships-change-group).
        3. Through inheritance. For example, any machines created for a license in group "ACME" will automatically be
           included into the same group.

        Below you will find the various attributes for the group resource. Groups can be utilized to associate multiple
        resources with eachother, as well as to define collective resource limits.

      description: |
        Below you will find the various attributes for the policy resource, as well as the policy resource's
        relationships. Your policies define the different types of licenses that a given product offers. For example,
        you may offer yearly licenses, as well as shorter time-limited free trial licenses that lack certain entitlements.

        Another example would be configuring a yearly software license that once expired, still functions normally, but
        is disallowed release upgrades after expiration. This is something you can accomplish using policies.

                will be stored unchanged.

                ### Options

                - **`ED25519_SIGN`**:
                  Sign license keys with your account's Ed25519 signing key, using elliptic curve cryptography and
                  SHA512. The given license key data will be base64url encoded and then prefixed with `key/` before
                  signing, and the signing data's signature will be base64url encoded and then appended onto the end of
                  the signing data, delimited by the `.` character, e.g.
                  `key/{URLBASE64URL_KEY}.{URLBASE64URL_SIGNATURE}`. This is our recommended signing scheme, but it may
                  not be supported in your preferred programming language.
                - **`RSA_2048_PKCS1_PSS_SIGN_V2**`:
                  Sign license keys with your account's 2048-bit RSA private key using RSA PKCS1-PSS padding, with a
                  SHA256 digest, max salt length, and a SHA256 MGF1. The provided embedded dataset will be base64url
                  encoded and then prefixed with `key/` before signing, and the signing data's signature will be
                  base64url encoded and then appended onto the end of the signing data, delimited by the `.` character,
                  e.g. `key/{URLBASE64URL_KEY}.{URLBASE64URL_SIGNATURE}`, resulting in the final key. This is our
                  recommended RSA scheme, but it may not be supported in your preferred programming language.
                - **`RSA_2048_PKCS1_SIGN_V2**`:
                  Sign license keys with your account's 2048-bit RSA private key using RSA PKCS1 v1.5 padding, with a
                  SHA256 digest. The provided embedded dataset will be base64url encoded and then prefixed with `key/`
                  before signing, and the signing data's signature will be base64url encoded and then appended onto the
                  end of the signing data, delimited by the `.` character, e.g.
                  `key/{URLBASE64URL_KEY}.{URLBASE64URL_SIGNATURE}`, resulting in the final key.
                - **`RSA_2048_PKCS1_ENCRYPT**`:
                  Encrypt license keys with your account's 2048-bit RSA private key using RSA PKCS1 v1.5 padding. The
                  provided dataset will be encrypted using your account's private key and then base64url encoded,
                  resulting in the final key. The key can be decrypted using your account's public key. The key must
                  contain no more than `245` bytes (please note this is *byte length* not *string length*).
                - **`RSA_2048_JWT_RS256**`:
                  Encode a license claims payload into a JWT using the RS256 algorithm. The license key must be a valid
                  JWT claims payload (i.e. a JSON encoded string). The JWT will be signed using your account's 2048-bit
                  RSA private key and can be verified using your account's public key. The resulting key will be a full
                  JSON Web Token. We do not modify your claims payload.

              description: |
                The strategy used for controlling whether or not dead machines and processes can be resurrected shortly
                after death. A resurrection occurs when a heartbeat ping is sent to a dead machine or process that is
                within its resurrection window.

                ### Options

                - **`NO_REVIVE`**: Do not allow dead machines and processes to be revived. This is the default.
                - **`1_MINUTE_REVIVE`**:
                  A machine or process can be revived if it sends a ping within 1 minute from its time of death.
                - **`2_MINUTE_REVIVE`**:
                  A machine or process can be revived if it sends a ping within 2 minutes from its time of death.

                  A machine or process can be revived if it sends a ping within 5 minutes from its time of death.
                - **`10_MINUTE_REVIVE`**:
                  A machine or process can be revived if it sends a ping within 10 minutes from its time of death.
                - **`15_MINUTE_REVIVE`**:
                  A machine or process can be revived if it sends a ping within 15 minutes from its time of death.
                - **`ALWAYS_REVIVE`**:
                  A machine or process can always be revived. Requires a cull strategy of `KEEP_DEAD`.

              description: |
                Control when a machine's initial heartbeat is started. By default, a machine's heartbeat is started on
                creation when its policy requires a heartbeat. Overwise, it is started on first ping.

                ### Options

                - **`FROM_CREATION`**: The heartbeat duration is calculated from the machine's creation time.
                - **`FROM_FIRST_PING`**: The heartbeat duration is calculated from the machine's first heartbeat ping.

                The matching strategy for machine fingerprints supplied during a license validation.

                ### Options

                - **`UNIQUE_PER_ACCOUNT`**:
                  Machine fingerprints must be unique across the entire Keygen account. This will block all duplicate
                  fingerprints, regardless of whether or not the fingerprint belongs to another product, policy or
                  license.
                - **`UNIQUE_PER_PRODUCT`**:
                  Machine fingerprints must be unique across all licenses belonging to a product. This will block all
                  duplicate fingerprints of the same product, regardless of whether or not the fingerprint belongs to
                  another policy or license.
                - **`UNIQUE_PER_POLICY`**:
                  Machine fingerprints must be unique across all licenses for the policy. This will block all duplicate
                  fingerprints of the same policy, regardless of whether or not the fingerprint belongs to another\
                  license.
                - **`UNIQUE_PER_LICENSE`**:
                  Machine fingerprints must be unique to the license. This will block all duplicate fingerprints for
                  same license, but the same fingerprint can exist across different licenses. This is the default.

              description: |
                The matching strategy for machine fingerprints supplied during a license validation.

                ### Options

                - **`MATCH_ANY`**:
                  At least 1 of the supplied fingerprints must match a fingerprint for the license's associated
                  machines. E.g. if 3 fingerprints are supplied, at least 1 of them must match.
                - **`MATCH_TWO`**:
                  At least 2 of the supplied fingerprints must match a fingerprint for the license's associated
                  machines. E.g. if 4 fingerprints are supplied, at least 2 of them must match.
                - **`MATCH_MOST`**:
                  The majority of supplied fingerprints must match the fingerprints for the license's associated
                  machines. E.g. if 3 fingerprints are supplied, at least 2 of them must match.
                - **`MATCH_ALL`**:
                  All supplied fingerprints must match the fingerprints for the license's associated machines. E.g. if 3
                  fingerprints are supplied, all 3 of them must match.

              description: |
                The strategy for expired licenses during a license validation and when accessing releases.

                ### Options

                - **`RESTRICT_ACCESS`**:
                  Expired licenses can continue to access releases published prior to their expiry, but automatic
                  upgrades are disabled. Validation scopes take precedence over expiry check during license validation.
                - **`REVOKE_ACCESS`**:
                  Expired licenses are no longer able to access any releases, including past releases and upgrades.
                  Expiry check takes precedence over scopes during license validation.
                - **`MAINTAIN_ACCESS`**:
                  Expired licenses can continue to access releases published prior to their expiry, but automatic
                  upgrades are disabled. Validation scopes take precedence over expiry check during license validation.
                  In addition, validations with an `EXPIRED` code will return `valid=true`.
                - **`ALLOW_ACCESS`**:
                  Expired licenses can access any releases, including past releases and future automatic upgrades.
                  Validation scopes take precedence over expiry check during license validation. In addition,
                  validations with an `EXPIRED` code will return `valid=true`.
            transferStrategy:
              type: string
              enum:
                - RESET_EXPIRY
                - KEEP_EXPIRY
              description: |
                Control whether a license's expiration is reset when transferred to this policy.

                ### Options

                - **`RESET_EXPIRY`**:
                  Reset the transferred license's expiry from the time of transfer. For example, if the license had an
                  expiry 3 months from now, and the new policy has a duration of 1 year, transferring would reset the
                  expiry to 1 year from the time of transfer. When the policy has no duration, the license's expiry is
                  removed.
                - **`KEEP_EXPIRY`**: Do not change the license's current expiry. This is the default.
            authenticationStrategy:
              type: string

              description: |
                The strategy used for authenticating as a license, for client-side integrations.

                ### Options

                - **`TOKEN`**:
                  Allow licenses to authenticate using [a license token](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/authentication/#license-tokens).
                  This is the default.
                - **`LICENSE`**: Allow licenses to authenticate using [a license key](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/authentication/#license-authentication).
                - **`MIXED`**: Allow both license token and license key authentication (each covered above).
                - **`NONE`**: Disable the ability for licenses to authenticate with the API.

                - PER_LICENSE
              description: |
                The strategy used for leasing machine processes.

                ### Options

                - **`PER_MACHINE`**:
                  Machine processes are counted per-machine, i.e. limits are enforced individually for each machine.
                  This is the default.
                - **`PER_LICENSE`**:
                  Machine processes are counted per-license, i.e. collectively across all of a license's machines.
            overageStrategy:
              type: string
              enum:
                - ALWAYS_ALLOW_OVERAGE
                - ALLOW_1_25X_OVERAGE
                - ALLOW_1_5X_OVERAGE
                - ALLOW_2X_OVERAGE
                - NO_OVERAGE
              description: |
                The strategy used for allowing machine, core and process overages. Set to `NO_OVERAGE` to disable
                overages altogether (attempts to exceed a limit will then result in an error).

                ### Options

                - **`ALWAYS_ALLOW_OVERAGE`**:
                  The license may exceed its limits, and doing so will not effect the licenses validity, i.e. the
                  following validation codes will return `valid=true`: `TOO_MANY_MACHINES`, `TOO_MANY_CORES`,
                  `TOO_MANY_PROCESSES`.
                - **`ALLOW_1_25X_OVERAGE`**:
                  The license may exceed its limits, up to a maximum of 1.25x. Exceeding a limit will not effect the
                  license's validity right away, i.e. the following validation codes will return `valid=true`:
                  `TOO_MANY_MACHINES`, `TOO_MANY_CORES`, `TOO_MANY_PROCESSES`. The license will begin to fail validation
                  once the 1.25x allowance has been exceeded. When using a 1.25x allowance, all resource limits must be
                  divisible by 4.
                - **`ALLOW_1_5X_OVERAGE`**:
                  The license may exceed its limits, up to a maximum of 1.5x. Exceeding a limit will not effect the
                  license's validity right away, i.e. the following validation codes will return `valid=true`:
                  `TOO_MANY_MACHINES`, `TOO_MANY_CORES`, `TOO_MANY_PROCESSES`. The license will begin to fail validation
                  once the 1.5x allowance has been exceeded. When using a 1.5x allowance, all resource limits must be
                  divisible by 2.
                - **`ALLOW_2X_OVERAGE`**:
                  The license may exceed its limits, up to a maximum of 2x. Exceeding a limit will not effect the
                  license's validity right away, i.e. the following validation codes will return `valid=true`:
                  `TOO_MANY_MACHINES`, `TOO_MANY_CORES`, `TOO_MANY_PROCESSES`.
                  The license will begin to fail validation once the 2x allowance has been exceeded.
                - **`NO_OVERAGE`**: Do not allow overages. Attempts to exceed limits will fail. This is the default.

        Keygen provides identity management for your customers, which allows you to authenticate them using an
        email/password by creating a [token](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/tokens/). The token can then be used to manage
        their resources in a client-side environment, e.g. activating machines, creating licenses, etc. In addition, it
        offers other features such as associating multiple licensing with a single user, a simple password reset flow,
        etc.

        Users don't necessarily need a password. The only required attribute for a user is an email address.
        Passwordless users can be useful for associating an email address to a license, for example, for a license key
        recovery flow.

        Below you will find the various attributes for the user resource, as well as the user resource's relationships.
        To modify a relationship, you will need to use the canonical link for the given resource.
